I’d like you to do a little research for the future.
There is a concept called “digital sustainability” that is already becoming popular in Europe and other countries.
Simply put, dynamic web expressions require a high power load, so the idea is to create something as simple and speedy as possible.
The article below contains a lot of information, so could you please translate it into English or Vietnamese and read it?

In particular, I would like to refer to the section “7 points to review your website”.
I’m particularly interested in “Jamstack configuration”, but I don’t know much about how to create this website.
And it seems that creating a static page site using Jamstack will be very fast. It can also be combined with WordPress CMS.
Could you please do some research in your free time?
